              The IoT Monitoring System is designed to manage and visualize environmental data, such
              as humidity levels, soil quality, and temperature, collected from various sensors. The
              systemâ€™s core functionality is to monitor and display real-time data, enabling users
              to make informed decisions based on the current conditions.
            </p>

              I focused on front-end and database development for this project. I was responsible
              for designing and setting up the database schema, as well as developing the UI using
              HTML. Bootstrap was chosen as the CSS framework for its ready-made components, which
              helped save development time and ensured responsiveness. I also integrated the
              frontend with backend APIs and the WebSocket server to retrieve data, enabling
              seamless real-time updates.
