              The IoT Monitoring System is designed to manage and visualize environmental data, such
              as humidity levels, soil quality, and temperature, collected from various sensors. The
              systemâ€™s core functionality is to monitor and display real-time data, enabling users
              to make informed decisions based on the current conditions.

              I focused on front-end and database development for this project. I was responsible
              for designing and setting up the database schema, as well as developing the UI
              dashboard using HTML and Bootstrap, which provided ready-made components that helped
              save development time and ensured responsiveness. I also connected front-end to the
              WebSocket server to receive real-time sensor data.
