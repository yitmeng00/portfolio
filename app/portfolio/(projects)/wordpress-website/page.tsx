            <p>
              I developed several WordPress websites for different clients related to Green IT
              infrastructure, construction, consultancy, IoT, and e-commerce using page builders
              such as Divi, Elementor, and WPBakery, along with a suite of essential plugins.
            </p>
            <p>
              My responsibilities included customizing themes to align with the clientâ€™s visual
              identity, optimizing images for fast loading, implementing SEO best practices to
              enhance search visibility, applying caching techniques to improve performance, and
              ensuring responsiveness across various screen sizes. Additionally, I managed aspects
              of web hosting setup to ensure site stability and accessibility, working with
              providers such as GoDaddy and Exabytes.
